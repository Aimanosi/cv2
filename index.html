        <h3>Architectural designer</h3>
        <p>I catch myself studying Design in things other people don’t think is possible. A designers will see design outside of their own interests;
          outside of websites and user interfaces if they’re a web designer, outside of business cards and letterheads if they’re a print designer,
          outside of furniture and wallpapers if they’re an interior designer,
          <br>
          I also produce images or visual representation of an architectural design with the aid of softwares like, Autodesk revit, sketchup, 3Ds max with vray
          or corona, lumion 3D fine tuned with tools like photoshop, corel draw and filmora for video editing.
